Almost heaven West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River
Life is old there
older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Growing like breeze
Country road take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia mountain mama
Take me home country road
All my memories gather round her
Miner's lady
stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty
painted on the sky
Misty taste of moon shine
Teardrop in my eye
Country road take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia mountain mama
Take me home country road
I hear her voice
In the morning hours
she calls me
The radio reminds me
of my home far away
And driving down the road
I get a feeling
That I should have been home
yesterday yesterday
Country road take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia mountain mama
Take me home country roads
Country road take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia mountain mama
Take me home country roads
Take me home country roads
Take me home country roads
